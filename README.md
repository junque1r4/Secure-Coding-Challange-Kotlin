Welcome to the Secure Kotlin Coding Challenge! This challenge is designed to test and improve your cybersecurity knowledge and skills, particularly when it comes to writing secure code in Kotlin. In this challenge, you'll be tasked with securing a vulnerable application using the Kotlin programming language.

My first thought's for the challange was put some tests to secure the application security but it was not a good idea, it will give too much spoiler about the vulnerabilities in the code and will
diminish the possibility of different solutions. So this challange doesn't have tests, and there's many ways to solve the vulnerabilities. 

Feel free to open a issue with your PR so we can debate your solution or even improve the challange!

## Story

In the fictional city of Koltinopolis, a thriving tech hub, a new cutting-edge startup, SuperCard, has emerged. SuperCard is an e-commerce platform that aims to provide a Nerd's Paradise for old card collectors. 

The company was founded by a group of young entrepreneurs who don't have much experience in the cybersecurity field. They have hired you as a cybersecurity expert to help them secure their application
and prevent it from being exploited by malicious actors.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Functionality: Your code should maintain the original functionality of the application.
- Bonus for Hardcore Players:
  - Readability: Your code should be easy to read and understand.
  - Maintainability: Your code should be easy to modify and extend in the future.
  - Performance: Your code should be optimized for performance and not introduce any unnecessary overhead.
