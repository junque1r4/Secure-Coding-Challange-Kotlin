Welcome to the Secure Kotlin Coding Challenge! This challenge is designed to test and improve your cybersecurity knowledge and skills, particularly when it comes to writing secure code in Kotlin. In this challenge, you'll be tasked with securing a vulnerable application using the Kotlin programming language.

## Story

In the fictional city of Koltinopolis, a thriving tech hub, a new cutting-edge startup, SuperCard, has emerged. SuperCard is an e-commerce platform that aims to provide a safe place for trading rare cards from users. However, the company's rapid growth has led to some oversights in the development of their platform. As a result, the platform has become vulnerable to various cyber attacks.

You have been hired as a cybersecurity expert to assess the situation and help SecureCard patch its vulnerable code. Your mission is to identify the security vulnerabilities in the provided Kotlin application and refactor the code to make it more secure, while maintaining its functionality.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Test Cases: Your code must pass all the test cases for the active module and any previous modules. For example, if you're working on Module 3, your code - should pass all test cases for Modules 3, 2, and 1.
- Functionality: Your code should maintain the original functionality of the application.
- Bonus for Hardcore Players:
  - Readability: Your code should be easy to read and understand.
  - Maintainability: Your code should be easy to modify and extend in the future.
  - Performance: Your code should be optimized for performance and not introduce any unnecessary overhead.

## Getting Started

To get started with the challenge, clone this repository and follow the instructions provided in the SETUP.md file. Good luck, and may the most secure code win!
